# Lungs-Cancer-Detection
This project aims to predict lung cancer types using SVM and PCA. The dataset underwent preprocessing, feature engineering, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. An SVM model was trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics. Future work includes expanding the dataset, exploring more feature engineering techniques, and optimizing hyperparameters.
